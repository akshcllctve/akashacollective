          <p>"I have never had a Reflexology treatment before nor do I particularly like anyone touching my feet. However, I took a chance with Irina Breslav and was handsomely rewarded with a more energetic and peaceful feeling after the treatment. I recommend her soft yet firm manner." </p>

          <p>"During the first session with Irina, she discovered a crystalline deposit on the bottom of my foot, which was sharply painful. By the tenth treatment, the deposit was dissolved, the discomfort was completely gone, and I experienced a feeling of relief and comfort. Irina’s work provides excellent support in assisting the body’s return to its natural state of homeostasis, as well as deep relaxation."</p>
