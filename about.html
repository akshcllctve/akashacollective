 <h4><strong>20 years experience, we learned the hard way so you don't have to.</h4></span>
<h2>Qualifications</h2>
<p>We've worked on all kinds of jobs for all kinds of companies.  From Fortune 100 companies, like Target Corporation, to 1 person start ups and everything in between. Along the way we've had the opportunity to work in all roles and functions, developing a holistic understanding of how organizations work. We are designers, supply chain managers, business analysts, accountants, marketing directors, strategic planners, human resource managers, business development finance officers and project managers. <strong>We understand the complex interactions and dependencies within organizations large and small and how to navigate them to effectively manage change and implement solutions to achieve goals.   </strong></p>

<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>Our strong operational and analytical background, coupled with our creative approach and tech savvy is unique.  We can look at intricate systems, from specific processes to entire organizations, quickly spot critical issues and implement creative solutions. Being an outsider with some distance can bring a powerful new perspective to what you are experiencing. There are a million reasons why products and companies fail.  We've seen over and over how one piece of the puzzle can hold back or bring down endeavors.  Earlier in our careers we quickly saw that we couldn't be effective focusing on one piece only.  How is a new website going to help you if your product doesn't fit the market?  How is a new sourcing strategy going to fix your sales?</p>

<h2>Network</h2>
<p>Working with all these companies and industries over the years we've met amazing, talented people. When you work with us, we share all of our network with you. We know the best professionals and consultants for every job.  From grant writing to photography to almost anything else you can think of. Whatever your needs, we can bring together the people and resources to get the job done right.  That's what the akasha collective is. With us anything is possible.
