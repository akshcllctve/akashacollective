Reflexology. A science which is based on the principle that there are reflexes in the feet which correspond to each organ, gland and all parts of the body. By properly working on these reflexes we can help to relieve many health problems in a natural way. A serious advance in the health field and should not be confused with massage. A reflex is an involuntary or unconscious response to a stimulus. </p>

When the reflexes on the feet are stimulated, an involuntary response is elicited in organs and glands connected by energy pathways to these specific reflexes. Reflexologist trigger the reflexes using specific thumb and finger techniques. Although the microcosmic representation of the body parts is also evident in the ears and on the hands, the feet are particularly sensitive, due to the abundance, of over 7,000 nerve endings present. Nerves conduct electrical impulses. Imagine these impulses as channels of energy which connect the feet to the rest of the body. </p>
