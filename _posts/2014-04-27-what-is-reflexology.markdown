<h1>Reflexology Explained</h1>
<img class="img-responsive" src="/img/feetchart.jpg">

<p>During my nine years as a board-certified reflexologist and reflexology teacher, Iâ€™ve witnessed an interesting evolution in people's questioning about this simple, yet profoundly effective complimentary modality to Western modern medicine.</p>

<p>First it was, "Reflexology? Never heard of it. What is it?" Then it was, "How can it help me with my health problem?" Now I am often asked, "How does it work? What is the science behind it?" There are many definitions of this health modality. Check out Reflexology Association of America (www.reflexology-usa.org) or American Reflexology Certification Board (www.arcb.net) Web sites. Reflexology is complimentary, biological, integrative health practice based on a highly specialized body of knowledge, where specific exercise pressure is applied to reflex areas in each foot, hand and ear. The goals are to achieve specific relaxation, in effect to restore a healthy energy pattern in the person, in addition to improve nerve, blood and lymphatic supply, thus persuading the body to biologically correct, strengthen and reinforce itself.

<p>Modern development of reflexology commenced around 1910, and yet research evaluating this phenomenon was not conducted for many years. Little research was conducted prior to 1977. Research requires expertise for its design, conduction and interpretation. For these reasons, even today in many countries, conducting research to evaluate reflexology is a challenge. With the establishment of the International Council of Reflexologists, it has become easier to obtain information about activities of reflexologists in other parts of the world. Networking has been greatly enhanced, and it has become apparent that each nation has had its own distinct pattern of development for the practice of reflexology. I have attended the three latest ICR conferences that took places in various parts of the globe and learned that in a few countries - China, Denmark and most recently the United Kingdom - reflexology has been recognized by the national government and has been integrated into the national health care system. The vast majority of research studies on reflexology originate in

<p>As a consequence, reflexology is used in these countries alongside allopathic medicine. In China, it is used together with traditional Chinese medicine as well.

</p><p>Over the past few years, the U.S. medical establishment has come on board validating reflexology as an effective therapy. Here's what some medical centers have to say:

</p><p>The California Pacific Medical Center: "Reflexology reduces stress, balances energy flow in the body and mind and supports the immune system. Though given on the hands and feet, this extraordinary 

</p><p>The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center: "Reflexology is a form of preventive medicine that aims to maintain a person's balance and well-being. Though empirical studies are lacking, many patients have benefited from reflexology. Conditions treated may include: migraine headache, hypertension, menstrual cramps or irregularities, myofacial pain, fibromyalgia, insomnia and anxiety disorders."

</p><p>Maryland Center for Integrative Medicine: "The benefits (of reflexology) include reduction in tension and stress, increased vascular, neural and lymphatic circulation, and the releasing of toxins. Research has shown that blood pressure can actually decrease during a session! Clients use reflexology to alleviate or manage asthma, sinus problems, digestive disorders, inflammations, menstrual irregularities, pain, fatigue, inflammatory skin conditions and other imbalances. It is especially beneficial for circulatory 

</p><p>The Memorial Sloan-Kettering's Cancer Center: "Reflexology is an ancient practice of applying pressure to specific parts of the feet and hands. A reflexology treatment is deeply relaxing and helps to reduce stress, relieve pain, increase circulation, and enhance well-being."

</p><p>Care Center at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical: "Nearly 60 percent of patients entering complimentary medicine use reflexology to release tension, encourage relaxation and enhance health."

</p><p>Hartford Hospital: "A way of stimulating the internal organs and increasing blood circulation to all areas of the body through the compression of reflex points on hands or most commonly, the feet."

</p><p>Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford: "The hands and feet are regarded as mirrors of the body. By applying a controlled amount of pressure to specific points on the feet or hands (reflex areas), the therapist can identify and treat problems in all parts of the body."

</p><p>Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital: "A reflexology treatment is deeply relaxing and helps to reduce stress, relieve pain, increase circulation and enhance well-being."

</p><p>The Heart Center at St. Rita's Medical Center offers open-heart patients reflexology as a complimentary therapy to help speed recovery and reduce discomfort. St. Rita's conducted a three-month pilot study on open-heart patients who received reflexology, and the study confirmed a patient's level of pain and anxiety decreased significantly. It also helped patients increase the distance they were able to walk, decreased the number of days they were hospitalized and the amount of medication administered during
