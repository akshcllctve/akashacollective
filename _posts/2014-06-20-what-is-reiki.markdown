<h1>What is Reiki?</h1>

<p class="lead">What is Reiki?</p>
<p>Reiki (pronounced Ray-Key) is a Japanese word representing Universal Life Energy, the energy which is all around us.</p>
<p>Reiki, when activated and applied for the purposes of healing, addresses body, mind and spirit. Although Reiki is a means of working with energy that we cannot see, it is not a religion, and requires no particular belief system. </p>
<p>The Usui System of Reiki, a natural healing art, was born out of the experience and dedication of Dr. Mikao Usui, a Japanese Christian educator. In the late 1800's Dr. Usui responded to a challenge from his university students by undertaking an extensive study of the healing phenomena of history's greatest spiritual leaders. Through travel, study, research and meditation he evolved a system of healing based on ancient Buddhist teachings. </p>

<p class="lead">Reiki Practitioner </p>
<p>The Reiki practitioner is a channel for the energy and is therefore not actually "doing" the healing. The recipient's body determines the actual flow of energy,also where and how the energy will be used in that body. A Reiki treatment is light touch, hands-on process. It works in conjunction with and as an adjunct to medical and non-medical therapy. </p>
<p>The experience of a Reiki treatment usually a deep feeling of warmth, well-being and comfort. Reiki healing is incorporated into each Reflexology session. </p>
